# If I were a boy again 
If I were a boy again,I would practise perseverance more often,and never give up a thing because it was hard or inconvenient.If we want light,we must conquer darkness.Perseverance can sometimes equal genius in its results.“There are only two creatures,”says a proverb;“who can surmount the pyramids-the eagle and the snail.”

谚语说：“能登上金字塔的生物只存在两种——老鹰和蜗牛。”假设咱们需要光亮,咱们就得要降服漆黑.在产生的成果方面,毅力常常能够与天才相比美。假设我再回到幼年,我会更多地培育自己的意志,决不能因为工作困难或费事而放弃

If I were a boy again,I would school myself into a habit of attention .I would let nothing come between me and the subject in hand.I would remember that a good skater never tries to skate in two directions at once.The habit of attention becomes part of our life,if we begin early enough.

假设我再回到幼年，我会培育出让自己聚精会神的行为；不管是不是手头有事，也决没有任何东西可以使我分神。我会紧记：一位优异的滑冰手从不会同时企图滑向两个不同的方向。假如及早养成聚精会神的优秀习惯，它就会成为咱们生命的一个部分。 
I often hear grown-up people say,“I could not fix my attention on the lecture or book,although I wished to do so,”and the reason is,the habit was not formed in youth.

我常听到大人们说：“虽然我希望自己集中注意力听讲课或读书，但经常做不到。”其原因就在于小时候没有养成这种习惯。

If I were to live my life over again,I would pay more attention to the cultivation of the memory.I would strengthen that faculty by every possible means, and,on every possible occasion.It takes a little hard work at first to remember things accurately;but memory soon helps itself,and gives very little trouble. It only needs early cultivation to become a power.

假如我能从头活过，我会愈加留意培育自己的记忆力。我要采纳全部可能的方法，在全部可能的场合,增强记忆力。要精确地记住全部事物，起先确实要作出一番小小的尽力；但不需要多久，记忆力自身就会起作用，使记忆成为轻而易举的事。只需尽早培育，记忆自会成为一种才干。

If I were a boy again, I would cultivate courage. "Nothing is so mild and gentle as courage, nothing so cruel and pitiless as cowardice," says a wise author.We too often borrow trouble, and anticipate that may never appear.The fear of ill exceeds the ill we fear.Dangers will arise in any career, but presence of mind will often conquer the worst of them.Be prepared for any fate, and there is no harm to be feared.

假设我又回到了幼年，我就要培育勇气。"世上没有东西比勇气更彬彬有礼，也没有东西比懦怯更残忍无情。"一位明智的写作家曾说过咱们常常过多地自寻烦恼，"杞人忧天。" 怕祸患比祸患自身更可怕,凡事都有风险，但镇定冷静往往能克服最严峻的风险。对全部祸福做好预备，那么就没有什么灾祸能够害怕的了。


If I were a boy again,I would look on the cheerful side.Life is very much like a mirror:if you smile upon it,it smiles back upon you;but if you frown and look doubtful on it,you will get a similar look in return.Inner sunshine warms not only the heart of the owner,but of all that come in contact with it.

假设我能再回到幼年，我会凡事都看光亮的一面。日子就像一面镜子：你朝它浅笑，它也会朝你浅笑：但如果你朝它皱眉头，它也会朝你皱眉头；内心的阳光不只温暖了自己的心，同时也温暖了一切跟他接触的人的心。

Who shuts love out,in turn shall be shut from love.

“谁将爱拒之门外，谁就会被爱拒之门外。”

If I were a boy again,I would school myself to say “No”oftener.I might write pages on the importance of learning very early in life to gain that point where a young boy can stand erect,and decline doing an unworthy act because it is unworthy.

假设我再回到幼年，我就要养成经常说“不”的习气。 我可以写上好几页，谈谈前期培育这一点的重要性,一个少年要能挺得起腰杆,拒绝做不值得做得事——就因为它不值得做。


If I were a boy again,I would demand of myself more courtesy towards my companions and friends,and indeed towards strangers as well.The smallest courtesies along the rough roads of life are like the little birds that sing to us all winter long,and make that season of ice and snow more endurable.Finally,instead of trying hard to be happy,as if that were the sole purpose of life,I would,if I were a boy again,try still harder to make others happy.

假设我再回到幼年，我会要求自己对待伙伴和朋友更讲理，而且对不认识的人也一样如此。在崎岖得人生道路上，最细微的礼貌都犹如在绵长的冬天为咱们唱歌的小鸟，使得天寒地冻的严冬变得更易忍耐。最后，假设我再回到幼年，我不会极力为自己谋幸福——仿佛那是人生的唯一目标；与之相反，我会更加尽力——让别人幸福。
